This is the website of Tech.Wow: A software business specialising in building Web Technologies, Python applications as well as Database Management systems for African people and businesses.  It operates from Lesotho in Southern Africa.

The website is composed of 5 responsive web pages (index.html, about.html, service.html, gallery.html and contact.html) that are built with HTML5, CSS and Javascript. 

When first visiting the home page, index.html, you're welcome by a blinking welcoming remark, "Welcome to our webisite!".  The motto underneath this blinking text tells the visitor who we are and what we do: "We are your number one software gurus." With these blinking text and motto, were are trying to catch the visitors' attention at first glance.

Then immediately we are taking you through the gallery where you will be able to browse through the loaded photos to get a snapshot of what we are doing. You will be able to interact with the photos by browsing back and forth with the "Prev and Next" buttons.  Then, underneath, we are pumping you with the information in 4 scrollable paragraphs about technology in Africa, where you will get the oppornity to learn about information why you will have to consider the services we are offering.

We understand that reading can be monotonous and exhausting sometimes. Therefore, we share a video that can be watched by visitors to relax their minds before navigating through our site. The vistor is able to play, pause, adjust the volume and download the video if they wish to do so. While in the Home page (index.html), you will never get lost because the sitemap indicates that you're still in the Home page with the "Home" active menu item shown in red text color. The active menu text color changes to red for every page you land to show where you are. As you are curiously exploring our Home page, wherever you click, the texts and font change dynamically. This happens also to other 4 pages mentioned.

The About page(about.html) tells you only about our vision, mission, objectives and values that we uphold. 

The service page (service.html) shows the service we are offering in a table of 3 columns and 3 rows. The links on these services we provide take you to the contact page (contact.html), where you will be able to send us messages, comments  and request a quotation. 

The Gallery page(gallery.htm) holds nothing other than loads of pictures that the visitor can browse through by either clicking the images in the preview panel above. When an image on a preview panel is clicked and without folowing an order, a large image version is shown underneath the preview panel. The vistor can also browse the images by using the "Previous and Next" buttons.

The Contact Page, contact.html contains a form that the user can fill to make a comment or request a quotation. The form is validated before is submited. When a submission is successful a green message thanking you is desplayed below the form. On the otherhand, when a form fails to submit a messege pops up requesting all textboxes to be filled or the user to insert right information.

Note: For this website to achieve all these, the symantic structure have been followed and all the pages have been set to run smoothly on mobile devices with small screens. Also the css been applied to give this website the applealing look and structure. The javascript helped us in animating the text, changing the text dynimically, loading and moving the images.
