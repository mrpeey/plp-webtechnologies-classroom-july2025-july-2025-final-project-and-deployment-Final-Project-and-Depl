The website is composed of 5 responsive web pages (index.html, about.html, service.html, gallery.html and contact.html) that are built with HTML5, CSS and Javascript. 

When first visiting the home page, index.html, you're greeted by a blinking welcoming remark, "Welcome to our webisite!".  The motto underneath this blinking text tells the visitor who we are and what we do: "We are your number one software gurus." With these blinking text and motto, were are trying to catch the visitors' attention at first glance.

We understand that reading can be monotonous and exhausting sometimes. Therefore, we share a video that can be watched by visitors to relax their minds before navigating through our site. The vistor is able to play, pause, adjust the volume and download the video if they wish to do so. While in the Home page (index.html), you will never get lost because the sitemap indicates that you're still in the Home page with the "Home" active menu item shown in red text color. The active menu text color changes to red for every page you land to show where you are. As you are curiously exploring our Home page, whenever you click on the page the texts and the fonts change dynamically. This happens also to other 4 pages mentioned.

The About page(about.html) tells you only about our vision, mission, objectives and values that we uphold. 

The service page (service.html) shows the service we are offering in a table of 3 columns and 3 rows. The links on these services we provide take you to the contact page (contact.html), where you will be able to send us messages, comments  and request a quotation. 

The Gallery page(gallery.htm) holds nothing other than loads of pictures that the visitor can browse through by either clicking the images in the picture grid above. When an image on the grid is clicked, and without folowing any order, a large image prevew is shown underneath the picture grid. While here, vistor can also browse the images by using the "Previous and Next" buttons.

The Contact Page, contact.html contains a form that the user can fill to make a comment or request a quotation. The form is validated before is submited. When a submission is successful a green message thanking you is displayed below the form. On the otherhand, when a form fails to submit a messege pops up requesting that all textboxes should be filled or prompts the user to insert correct information.
